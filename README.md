# MSSqlServer.sql

In this guided project I learned how to perform core job-related tasks within the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) environment. I use the tools in SSMS to automatically generate queries, manage security permissions, create dependent scripts, and create and backup a database. I gained hands-on practices performing these tasks using real data in a SQL Server Database.
